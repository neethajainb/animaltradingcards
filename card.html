				Although dogs look very different from people, they share many of our body’s characteristics. They have a heart and circulatory system to transport blood, lungs to take in oxygen and rid the body of carbon dioxide, a digestive tract to absorb nutrients from food, and so on. However, it is the differences between dogs and people that are most interesting and that give dogs their unique characteristics as family members.
